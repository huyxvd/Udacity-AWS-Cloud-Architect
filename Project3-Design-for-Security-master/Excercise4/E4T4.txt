1. What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.
	move the web application instance to the private subnet.
2. Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
	the answer is YES. we can create AWS VPC S3 Enpoint to access S3 from VPC. improve the security & performance since the read s3 bucket are not leave AWS network.
3. Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
	the answer is NO. default encryption does not change the encryption of existing objects in the same bucket. but you could to it with AWS CLI but not directly.
4. The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?
	it will not affect in case we create new resource with Cloud-Formation. if we do want to make it work then we had to update the Cloud-Formation .yml file
