Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Web Service Instance should not place in the public subnet & facing with internet because we have load balancer already do that.
instead we should place "Web Service Instance" in the private subnet & only allow connect from load balancer(meaning security-group only allow from load balancer security-group)

# Poor practice 2
S3 should have resource policy which only allow access from Web Service Instance & the connection should not leave AWS network.
Amazon S3 VPC endpoints enabling them to ensure that only specific buckets can be accessed from within their VPC
